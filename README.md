Python Script Boilerplate

## What is pylerplate?
Pylerplate is your base repository to create your own amazing scripts.

### Basic skeleton
You don't need to worry anymore thinking on if your file structure is good
enough to push it to your own repo, this is already done on this repository.

### Tests samples
Because with tests, everything's better.
Using tox you could test with different packages versions, python versions...
etc. You could even create autodoc everytime you execute it. Awesome!

### Setup.py
Even there's also an example of how to create your own python executable files!

### Pydocs
Imagine that you don't need to document anymore... Would be great right? Stop
imagining and start using doc strings. Sphinx rules!

## Help the community
Python is amazing, help people to improve their code by following the best
practices.
